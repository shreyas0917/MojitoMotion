## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a frontend enthusiast passionate about micro-interactions and smooth UX, I created this project to:

- Practice advanced animation control using **GSAP in React**
- Explore **ScrollTrigger**, timeline chaining, and staggered effects
- Demonstrate animation-ready component design for portfolios
- Push the boundaries of creative UI in React with modern libraries

## 🎥 Highlighted GSAP Concepts Used

- `gsap.timeline()` for chaining animations ⛓️
- `ScrollTrigger.create()` for scroll-based transitions 🔄
- `.fromTo()` and `.to()` for precise control over animations 🎛️
- `matchMedia` logic to handle mobile vs desktop behavior 📱🖥️
